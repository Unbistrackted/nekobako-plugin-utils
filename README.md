# nekobako-plugin-utils 

A simple library that makes my life easier while making plugins for skyline - Creates/Manages configs using [skyline-config](https://github.com/skyline-rs/skyline-config) and checks BUILD INFO for ``Umineko no Naku Koro ni Saku ~Nekobako to Musou no Koukyoukyoku~``

``Title ID:01006A300BA2C000``

## Special thanks to:

https://github.com/DCNick3 for the tools he created, the time explaining how the basics works, and all sorts of things that would not have made this possible without his help.

( I can't really express how grateful I am, never thought I could pull this off)
